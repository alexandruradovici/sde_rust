# Homework 1 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Make the source code work:

```rust
struct Complex {
    r: f64,
    i: f64
}

fn main () {
    let n1 = Complex::new (2, 3);
    let n2 = Complex::new (-2, 3);
    let n3 = Complex::new (2, -3);
    let n4 = Complex::new (3, 0);
    let n5 = Complex::new (0, 3);

    println! ("The number is {}", n1); // prints 2+3i
    println! ("The number is {}", n2); // prints -2+3i
    println! ("The number is {}", n3); // prints 2-3i
    println! ("The number is {}", n4); // prints 3
    println! ("The number is {}", n5); // prints 3i

    println! ("The number is {}", n1-n1); // prints 0
    println! ("The number is {}", n1+n2); 
    println! ("The number is {}", n1-n2);
    println! ("The number is {}", n1*n2);
}
```
  - Hint: use the Display, Add, Sub and Mul traits. 
  - Read the compiler hints carefully.

---
# Deriving

- Many traits are so straightforward that the compiler can often implement them
  for you.
- A `#[derive(...)]` attribute tells the compiler to insert a default
  implementation for whatever traits you tell it to.
- This removes the tedium of repeatedly manually implementing traits like `Clone` yourself!

```rust
#[derive(Copy, Clone, Eq, PartialEq, Debug)]
struct Complex {
    r: f64,
    i: f64
}
```

---
## Derivable Traits

- You can derive the following core traits:
    - `Clone`, `Copy`, `Debug`, `Default`, `Eq`,
    - `Hash`, `Ord`, `PartialEq`, `PartialOrd`.
- Deriving custom traits is also supported! (e.g. see [`serde`](https://serde.rs/) and [`diesel`](http://diesel.rs/))
- Careful: deriving a trait won't always work.
    - Can only derive a trait on a data type when all of its members can have derived the trait.
    - e.g., `Eq` can't be derived on a struct containing only `f32`s, since
      `f32` is not `Eq`.

---
## Core traits

- It's good to be familiar with the core traits.
    - `Clone`, `Copy`
    - `Debug`
    - `Default`
    - `Eq`, `PartialEq`
    - `Hash`
    - `Ord`, `PartialOrd`

---
### Clone

```rust
pub trait Clone: Sized {
    fn clone(&self) -> Self;

    fn clone_from(&mut self, source: &Self) { ... }
}
```
- A trait which defines how to duplicate a value of type `T`.
- This can solve ownership problems.
    - You can clone an object rather than taking ownership or borrowing!
- [Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html)

---
### Clone

```rust
#[derive(Clone)] // without this, Bar cannot derive Clone.
struct Foo {
    x: i32,
}

#[derive(Clone)]
struct Bar {
    x: Foo,
}
```

---
### Copy
```rust
pub trait Copy: Clone { }
```
- `Copy` denotes that a type has "copy semantics" instead of "move semantics."
- Type must be able to be copied by copying bits (`memcpy`).
    - Types that contain references _cannot_ be `Copy`.
- Marker trait: does not implement any methods, but defines behavior instead.
- [Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Copy.html)

---
### Debug

```rust
pub trait Debug {
    fn fmt(&self, &mut Formatter) -> Result;
}
```

- Defines output for the `{:?}` formatting option.
- Generates debug output, not pretty printed.
- Generally speaking, you should always derive this trait.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

let origin = Point { x: 0, y: 0 };
println!("The origin is: {:?}", origin);
// The origin is: Point { x: 0, y: 0 }
```
- [Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Debug.html)

---
### Default

```rust
pub trait Default: Sized {
    fn default() -> Self;
}
```
- Defines a default value for a type.
- Often can be derived, but sometimes it has to be implemented explicitly.
- [Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/default/trait.Default.html)

---
### Eq vs. PartialEq

```rust
pub trait PartialEq<Rhs: ?Sized = Self> {
    fn eq(&self, other: &Rhs) -> bool;

    // example of default trait method implementation
    fn ne(&self, other: &Rhs) -> bool { 
        !self.eq (other)
    }
}

pub trait Eq: PartialEq<Self> {}
```
- Traits for defining equality via the `==` operator.

---
### Eq vs. PartialEq

- `PartialEq` represents a _partial equivalence relation_.
    - Symmetric: if a == b then b == a
    - Transitive: if a == b and b == c then a == c
- `ne` has a default implementation in terms of `eq`.
- `Eq` represents a _total equivalence relation_.
    - Symmetric: if a == b then b == a
    - Transitive: if a == b and b == c then a == c
    - **Reflexive: a == a**
- `Eq` does not define any additional methods.
    - (It is also a Marker trait.)
- For example, in floating point numbers `NaN != NaN`,
    so floating point types implement `PartialEq` but not `Eq`.

---
### Ord vs. PartialOrd

```rust
pub trait PartialOrd<Rhs: ?Sized = Self>: PartialEq<Rhs> {
    // Ordering is one of Less, Equal, Greater
    fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Rhs) -> Option<Ordering>;

    fn lt(&self, other: &Rhs) -> bool { ... }
    fn le(&self, other: &Rhs) -> bool { ... }
    fn gt(&self, other: &Rhs) -> bool { ... }
    fn ge(&self, other: &Rhs) -> bool { ... }
}
```
- Traits for values that can be compared for a sort-order.

---
### Ord vs. PartialOrd

- The comparison must satisfy, for all `a`, `b` and `c`:
  - Antisymmetry: if `a < b` then `!(a > b)`, as well as `a > b` implying `!(a < b)`; and
  - Transitivity: `a < b` and `b < c` implies `a < c`. The same must hold for both `==` and `>`.
- `lt`, `le`, `gt`, `ge` have default implementations based on `partial_cmp`.

---
### Ord vs. PartialOrd

```rust
pub trait Ord: Eq + PartialOrd<Self> {
    fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Ordering;
}
```
- Trait for types that form a total order.
- An order is a total order if it is (for all `a`, `b` and `c`):
  - total and antisymmetric: exactly one of `a < b`, `a == b` or `a > b` is true; and
  - transitive, `a < b` and `b < c` implies `a < c`. The same must hold for both `==` and `>`.
- For example, for floating point numbers, `NaN < 0 == false` and `NaN >= 0 == false` (cf. IEEE 754-2008 section 5.11).
- See `std::cmp` [documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/index.html) for more information.

---
### Hash

```rust
pub trait Hash {
    fn hash<H: Hasher>(&self, state: &mut H);

    fn hash_slice<H: Hasher>(data: &[Self], state: &mut H)
        where Self: Sized { ... }
}
```
- A hashable type.
- The `H` type parameter is an abstract hash state used to compute the hash.
- If you also implement `Eq`, there is an additional, important property:
```rust
k1 == k2 -> hash(k1) == hash(k2)
```
- [Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/hash/trait.Hash.html)

# Homework 2 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Make the source code work:

```rust
struct Complex {
    r: f64,
    i: f64
}

fn main () {
    let n1 = Complex::new (2, 3);
    let n2 = Complex::new (-2, 3);
    let n3 = Complex::new (2, -3);
    let n4 = Complex::new (3, 0);
    let n5 = Complex::new (0, 3);

    println! ("The number is {}", n1); // prints 2+3i
    println! ("The number is {}", n2); // prints -2+3i
    println! ("The number is {}", n3); // prints 2-3i
    println! ("The number is {}", n4); // prints 3
    println! ("The number is {}", n5); // prints 3i

    println! ("The number is {}", n1-n1); // prints 0
    println! ("The number is {}", n1+n2); 
    println! ("The number is {}", n1-n2);
    println! ("The number is {}", n1*n2);
    println! ("The numbers {} and {} are {}", n1, n2, if n1==n2 { "equal"} else {"not equal"});
}
```
  - Hint: use the source from the previous workpoint, look at the `PartialEq` traits. 
  - Read the compiler hints carefully.

# Homework 3 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Find a way to order these numbers and make the source work.
```rust
struct Complex {
    r: f64,
    i: f64
}

fn main () {
    let n1 = Complex::new (2, 3);
    let n2 = Complex::new (-2, 3);

    println! ("The number is {}", n1); // prints 2+3i
    println! ("The number is {}", n2); // prints -2+3i

    println! ("The number is {}", n1<n2);
    println! ("The number is {}", n1<=n2); 
    println! ("The number is {}", n1>n2);
    println! ("The number is {}", n1>=n2);
}
```
